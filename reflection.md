- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think inheritance is extremely useful in programming, since it significantly reduces the amount of coding necessary to create a new class and the likelihood of mistakes. Not using inheritance when it can be applied would waste a lot of time.

This project overall was pretty simple. The attributes of the classes were very easy to implement, and most of the methods are simple. The main part that gave me trouble was the sellCoffee method of the Cafe class. Originally I misunderstood the directions, and thought that I was supposed to restock the supplies only by the amount needed, and then make the coffee. This didn't make sense to me, since you might as well just set all of the attributes to 0 at that point. But eventually I realized it was supposed to be restocked by a larger amount.

I would tell someone taking this course in the future to read the directions carefully and check the Slack before starting, since it took me a while to realize that my question was already answered.
